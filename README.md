# VIS174-Final-Electronic-Technologies-for-Art
My final project with Todd Everett for VIS174 Electronic Technologies for Art. Completed at University of California, San Diego.

The final product is an LED Etch-A-Sketch installation for an interactive digital art gallery.
The product consists of a few simple components: an Arduino Uno, two potentiometers, a button, 10 shift registers, lots of LEDs, and ping pong balls as diffusers. Here's a link to a short clip of the making and use: https://vimeo.com/148312115
