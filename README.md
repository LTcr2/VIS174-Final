# VIS174-Final-Electronic-Technologies-for-Art
My final project for VIS174 Electronic Technologies for Art. Completed at University of California, San Diego.
The final product is an LED Etch-A-Sketch installation for an interactive digital art gallery.
The product consists of a few simple components: an Arduino Uno, two potentiometers, a button, 10 shift registers, lots of LEDs, and ping pong balls as diffusers.
